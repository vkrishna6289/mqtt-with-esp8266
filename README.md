This project implements an IoT-based object detection system using an ESP8266 microcontroller, an IR sensor, and the MQTT communication protocol. The ESP8266 connects to a Wi-Fi network and communicates with the public HiveMQ MQTT broker to publish real-time sensor data. The IR sensor continuously monitors the presence of objects, and based on its output, the ESP8266 publishes messages indicating either “Object Detected” or “No Object” to a specific MQTT topic. These messages can be viewed using any MQTT client or web-based dashboard by subscribing to the configured topic. The project demonstrates the integration of sensors with wireless communication and MQTT, making it suitable for applications such as smart monitoring systems, security solutions, and basic IoT automation.
